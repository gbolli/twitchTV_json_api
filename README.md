# twitchTV json api
fCC project to create a site to view twitch accounts status and link to streams

Project requires use of https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api as a workaround for the twitch API.  This is due to the fact that twitch requires an API key which would be revealed publicly on Codepen.  The workaround has limited data to work with.
